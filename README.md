# screenshot-to-code README

This project is a Visual Studio Code extension that converts screenshots of websites into React code. The extension uses the Open AI API for image recognition & code generation.

It also uses Color Thief to extract the color palette from the screenshot and apply it to the generated code using a simple color matching algorithm.
